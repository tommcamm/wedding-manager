## üìã Functional Requirements

1. **One invite per family**  
   *An invite may already list multiple family members; each can RSVP separately. Additional +1s can be added or removed up to the specified allowance **before the deadline**.*

2. **RSVP Deadline**  
   *A configurable cutoff date after which the guest portal locks. Guests see a message directing them to contact the couple for any modifications.*

3. **Dietary Preferences & Allergies**  
   *Captured individually for every named attendee and +1.*

4. **Gift Flexibility**  
   *Guests can choose a registry item **or** contribute via linked e-money boxes. A note clarifies that all forms of gifts, including cash, are appreciated.*

5. **Real-time Admin Visibility**  
   *All RSVPs, notes, and gift selections appear instantly in the admin dashboard.*

6. **Localization**  
   *All content (UI labels, emails, registry text, etc.) must be translatable into English, Italian, and Chinese.*

---

## üåç Localization Strategy

* **Language indicator** is embedded in each invite URL/QR code (`/invite/ABCDE?lang=it`).  
* Translatable strings live in resource files (`en.json`, `it.json`, `zh.json`).  
* Admin dashboard includes an editor for live translation updates.
